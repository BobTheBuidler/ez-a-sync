    This class allows objects to be iterated over using either a
    standard `for` loop or an `async for` loop, making it versatile
    in scenarios where the mode of iteration (synchronous or asynchronous)
    needs to be flexible or is determined at runtime.

    The class achieves this by implementing both `__iter__` and `__aiter__`
    methods, enabling it to return appropriate iterator objects that can
    handle synchronous and asynchronous iteration, respectively. However,
    note that synchronous iteration relies on the :class:`ASyncIterator`

    fetch items. This can raise a `RuntimeError` if the event loop is
    already running, and in such cases, a :class:`~a_sync.exceptions.SyncModeInAsyncContextError`

class ASyncIterator(_AwaitableAsyncIterableMixin[T], Iterator[T]):
    """
    A hybrid Iterator/AsyncIterator implementation that bridges the gap between synchronous and asynchronous iteration. This class provides a unified interface for iteration that can seamlessly operate in both synchronous (`for` loop) and asynchronous (`async for` loop) contexts. It allows the wrapping of asynchronous iterable objects or async generator functions, making them usable in synchronous code without explicitly managing event loops or asynchronous context switches.

    By implementing both `__next__` and `__anext__` methods, ASyncIterator enables objects to be iterated using standard iteration protocols while internally managing the complexities of asynchronous iteration. This design simplifies the use of asynchronous iterables in environments or frameworks that are not inherently asynchronous, such as standard synchronous functions or older codebases being gradually migrated to asynchronous IO.

    Note:
        Synchronous iteration with `ASyncIterator` uses `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete`, which can raise a `RuntimeError` if the event loop is already running. In such cases, a :class:`~a_sync.exceptions.SyncModeInAsyncContextError` is raised from the `RuntimeError`, indicating that synchronous iteration is not possible in an already running event loop.

class ASyncGeneratorFunction(Generic[P, T]):
    """
    Encapsulates an asynchronous generator function, providing a mechanism to use it as an asynchronous iterator with enhanced capabilities. This class wraps an async generator function, allowing it to be called with parameters and return an :class:`~ASyncIterator` object. It is particularly useful for situations where an async generator function needs to be used in a manner that is consistent with both synchronous and asynchronous execution contexts.

    The ASyncGeneratorFunction class supports dynamic binding to instances, enabling it to be used as a method on class instances. When accessed as a descriptor, it automatically handles the binding to the instance, thereby allowing the wrapped async generator function to be invoked with instance context ('self') automatically provided. This feature is invaluable for designing classes that need to expose asynchronous generators as part of their interface while maintaining the ease of use and calling semantics similar to regular methods.

    By providing a unified interface to asynchronous generator functions, this class facilitates the creation of APIs that are flexible and easy to use in a wide range of asynchronous programming scenarios. It abstracts away the complexities involved in managing asynchronous generator lifecycles and invocation semantics, making it easier for developers to integrate asynchronous iteration patterns into their applications.

        ...     yield 1
