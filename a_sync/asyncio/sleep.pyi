    """Skip one event loop run cycle.

    This is a hacky helper for 'asyncio.sleep()', used
    when the 'delay' is set to 0. It yields exactly one
    time (which Task.__step knows how to handle) instead
    of creating a Future object. We monkey patch asyncio
    with our helper so it "just works" without you doing
    anything.

    While asyncio.sleep(0) is already very well-optimized,
    this equivalent helper consumes about 10% less compute
    than asyncio's equivalent internal helper.
